This set contains certificates that are publicly trusted as part of the Mozilla
Root Program, which is the underlying root program that both Android and Chrome
participate in. It is suitable for clients that want to validate HTTPS
certificate chains served by properly configured HTTPS servers.

This target is expected to update one or two times a quarter / four to eight
times a year.
